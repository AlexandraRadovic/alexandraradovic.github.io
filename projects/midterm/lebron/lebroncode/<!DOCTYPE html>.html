    <h1>Ranking the Biggest NBA Finals Carry Job</h1>

    <p>Artistic interpretation of LeBron James carrying Kyle Korver. Other teammates not pictured, but also carried.

    <h2><em>Advanced stat haters should stop reading.</em></h2>

    ><p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them to the finals more than others. Did Giannis do it without help? <em>Not really.</em> Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is LeBron amazing? Yes.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this already. So I figured I would add my data-driven take to the mix. What do the data say about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in NBA history?</p>
        <p>The data say that LeBron’s (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers reigns supreme.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat RAPTOR WAR (WAR) 
            created by 538, a good measure for how many wins a player contributed vs. 
            what a replacement level player would. But we canât just measure who had 
            the highest WAR in isolation since both games and minutes played factor 
            in. It needs to be relative to the rest of the team.</p>
            <p>To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look at the WAR share 
            among the top three players on a team. I couldâve picked any number of 
            players to compare, but most great teams have at least two or three stars, 
            with the rest filling in as role players, so three is the magic 
            number.</p></li>

        <li><p>Wade tops the list for finals winners, carrying the load with an aging 
            Shaq</p>

            <p>LeBron was just so good in Miami that even with other stars his numbers 
            were crazy</p>

            <p>Dirkâs final run is often cited as a carry job, but the data prefer 
            his first appearance</p>

        <img src="file:///Users/alexandraradovic/Desktop/Github/alexandraradovic.github.io/projects/midterm/lebron/assets/chart-3.png" class="img-fluid">

            <p>The biggest surprise here as Hakeemâs first title usually sits atop 
            most lists</p>

            <p>Less minutes for Giannis and some stellar support put this in the 
            bottom</p>

            <p>To summarize: the data say that LeBron is Mr. Playoffs, and some of the 
            most epic carry jobs were done by finals losers, who maybe just needed one 
            more piece to the puzzle to win it all. But mostly, this is another 
            perspective to add to these on-going debates.</p>

            <p>Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players 
            with 150+ minutes played. There are a lot of metrics out there, and they 
            can all be great and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a 
            cumulative stat was chosen.</p>
