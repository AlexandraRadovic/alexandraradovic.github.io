    <h1>Ranking the biggest NBA finals carry jobs</h1>

        <h2>LeBron haters should stop reading now</h2>

        <p>Artistic interpretation of LeBron James carrying Kyle Korver. Other 
        teammates not pictured, but also carried.</p>

" target="_blank">RAPTOR WAR</a>

   
<p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them 
    to the finals more than others. Did Giannis do it without help?ot 
    really. Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is LeBron amazing? 
    Yes.</p>

    <img src="img/chart-1.png" class="img-fluid" width=600 height=800>

    
    <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this 
    already. So I figured I would add my data-driven take to the mix. What do 
    the data say about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in NBA 
    history?</p>
    
    <p>The data say that LeBronâs (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers 
    reigns supreme.</p></p>

    <h2>Advanced stat haters should stop reading</h2>

    <p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat RAPTOR WAR (WAR) 
        created by 538, a good measure for how many wins a player contributed vs. 
        what a replacement level player would. But we canât just measure who had 
        the highest WAR in isolation since both games and minutes played factor 
        in. It needs to be relative to the rest of the team.</p>

        <img src="img/chart-3.png" class="img-fluid" width=600 height=800>
       
       
        <p>To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look at the WAR share 
        among the top three players on a team. I couldâve picked any number of 
        players to compare, but most great teams have at least two or three stars, 
        with the rest filling in as role players, so three is the magic 
        number.</p>

        <img src="img/chart-4.png" class="img-fluid" width=600 height=800>

        <p>Wade tops the list for finals winners, carrying the load with an aging 
            Shaq</p>
            
            <p>LeBron was just so good in Miami that even with other stars his numbers 
            were crazy</p>
            
            <p>Dirkâs final run is often cited as a carry job, but the data prefer 
            his first appearance</p>

            <p>The biggest surprise here as Hakeemâs first title usually sits atop 
            most lists</p>

            <p>Less minutes for Giannis and some stellar support put this in the 
            bottom</p>

            <img src="img/chart-5.png" class="img-fluid" width=600 height=800>
            
            <p>To summarize: the data say that LeBron is Mr. Playoffs, and some of the 
            most epic carry jobs were done by finals losers, who maybe just needed one 
            more piece to the puzzle to win it all. But mostly, this is another 
            perspective to add to these on-going debates.</p>
            
            <p>Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players 
            with 150+ minutes played. There are a lot of metrics out there, and they 
            can all be great and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a 
            cumulative stat was chosen.</p>
